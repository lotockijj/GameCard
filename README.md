Game is played 24 or 52 cards. The number players is not limited. 
All cards are dealt to the players equally.
First cards laid out is nine(two) hearts depend full(52 cards) or short deck is played.
The rules are simple: the card lying on top you can put any card of the same value or more. Suits do not matter.
Each player, in turn, puts one card.
If a player has four cards of the same value, he can put them together in one turn (if the top card - nine of hearts, it can be laid at the same time the remaining three nines).
If a player can not or does not want to put another card, he must take the top three cards  or more(Nine of Hearts is not taken).
Additional rules: all cards are placed on one another, and can not spy on what cards are already in the deck.
Despite the seeming simplicity of the game, its outcome depends not on the initial distribution, but on the player's skill.
